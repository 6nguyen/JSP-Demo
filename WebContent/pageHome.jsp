<jsp:include page="pageHeader.html" />

<p>This web page uses a pre-existing html header file to generate a header
for all of its pages.  It also uses a pre-existing jsp footer file to
generate footers for all of its pages.</p>

<p>The file type of the files is not important, html and jsp were just used
as an example.</p>

<br/>
<p align="left">To include files, use: &#60;jsp:include page="nameOfFile.fileType"/&#62;</p>
